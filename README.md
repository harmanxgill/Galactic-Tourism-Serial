# Galactic Tourism: Mapping Cosmic Transparency

## Overview
This project simulates the intergalactic medium (IGM) using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and computes cosmic transparency maps based on particle density and the Madau model for redshift attenuation. It leverages MPI and OpenMP for high-performance parallelization, making it suitable for large-scale simulations on modern clusters.
